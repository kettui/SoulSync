## What It Does

SoulSync bridges streaming services to your music library with automated discovery:

1. **Monitors artists** → Automatically detects new releases from your watchlist
2. **Generates playlists** → Release Radar, Discovery Weekly, Seasonal, Decade/Genre mixes, Cache-powered discovery
3. **Downloads missing tracks** → From Soulseek, Deezer, Tidal, Qobuz, HiFi, YouTube, or any combination via Hybrid mode
4. **Verifies downloads** → AcoustID fingerprinting for all download sources
5. **Enriches metadata** → 10 enrichment workers (Spotify, MusicBrainz, iTunes, Deezer, Discogs, AudioDB, Last.fm, Genius, Tidal, Qobuz)
6. **Tags consistently** → Picard-style MusicBrainz release preflight ensures all album tracks get the same release ID
7. **Organizes files** → Custom templates for clean folder structures
8. **Manages library** → Plex, Jellyfin, Navidrome, or SoulSync Standalone (no media server required)
9. **Scrobbles plays** → Automatic scrobbling to Last.fm and ListenBrainz from your media server

### Listening Stats & Scrobbling

**Listening Stats Page** — Full dashboard with Chart.js visualizations
- Overview cards: total plays, listening time, unique artists/albums/tracks
- Timeline bar chart, genre breakdown donut with legend
- Top artists visual bubbles, top albums and tracks with play buttons and cover art
- Library health: format breakdown bar, enrichment coverage rings, database storage chart
- Time range filters: 7 days, 30 days, 12 months, all time

**Scrobbling** — Automatic Last.fm and ListenBrainz scrobbling from Plex, Jellyfin, or Navidrome

### Audio Verification

**AcoustID Fingerprinting** (optional) — Verifies downloaded files match expected tracks
- Runs for all download sources (Soulseek, Tidal, Qobuz, HiFi, Deezer, YouTube)
- Catches wrong versions (live, remix, cover) even from streaming API sources
- Fail-open design: verification errors never block downloads

### Metadata & Enrichment

**10 Background Enrichment Workers**: Spotify, MusicBrainz, iTunes, Deezer, Discogs, AudioDB, Last.fm, Genius, Tidal, Qobuz
- Each worker independently processes artists, albums, and tracks
- Pause/resume controls on dashboard, auto-pause during database scans
- Error items don't auto-retry in infinite loops (fixed in v2.1)

**Multi-Source Metadata**
- Primary source selectable: Spotify, iTunes/Apple Music, Deezer, or Discogs
- Spotify no longer auto-overrides — user chooses their preferred source in Settings
- Spotify auth still enables playlists, followed artists, and enrichment
- MusicBrainz enrichment with Picard-style album consistency

**Hydrabase** (optional P2P metadata network) — replaces iTunes as the metadata source when connected. Federated lookup with community-matched results, falls back automatically if disconnected. Dev-mode feature, enable in Settings → Connections.

**Genre Whitelist** — filter junk genre tags (artist names, radio show names, playlist names) from all 10 enrichment sources. 272 curated default genres, fully customizable. Off by default for backward compatibility.

**Post-Processing Tag Embedding**
- Granular per-service tag toggles (18+ MusicBrainz tags, Spotify/iTunes/Deezer IDs, AudioDB mood/style, Tidal/Qobuz ISRCs, Last.fm tags, Genius URLs)
- Multi-artist tagging options: configurable separator (comma/semicolon/slash), multi-value ARTISTS tag for Navidrome/Jellyfin multi-artist linking, optional "move featured artists to title" mode
- Album art embedding, cover.jpg download
- Spotify rate limit protection across all API calls

### Advanced Matching Engine

- Version-aware matching: strictly rejects remixes when you want the original (and vice versa)
- Unicode and accent handling (KoЯn, Bjork, A$AP Rocky)
- Fuzzy matching with weighted confidence scoring (title, artist, duration)
- Album variation detection (Deluxe, Remastered, Taylor's Version, etc.)
- Streaming source match validation: same confidence scoring applied to Tidal/Qobuz/HiFi/Deezer results as Soulseek
- Short title protection: prevents "Love" from matching "Loveless"

### Automation

**Automation Engine** — Visual drag-and-drop builder for custom workflows
- **Triggers**: Schedule, Daily/Weekly Time, Track Downloaded, Batch Complete, Playlist Changed, Discovery Complete, Signal Received, Library Scan Complete, Watchlist Match, Wishlist Item Added, and more
- **Actions**: Process Wishlist, Scan Watchlist, Refresh Mirrored, Discover Playlist, Sync Playlist, Scan Library, Database Update, Quality Scan, Full Cleanup, and 10+ more
- **Then Actions** (up to 3 per automation): Fire Signal (chain to other automations), Discord/Telegram/Pushbullet notifications, audible chimes
- **Signal Chains** — One automation fires `signal:foo`, another listens for it. Cycle detection + chain depth limit + cooldown prevent runaway chains.
- **Playlist Pipeline** — Single automation for full playlist lifecycle: refresh → discover → sync → download missing. No manual signal wiring.
- **Pipelines** — Pre-built one-click deployments (New Music, Nightly Operations, Full Library Maintenance, etc.) that install a linked group of automations at once
- **Automation Groups** — Drag-and-drop organization, bulk enable/disable, rename, right-click context menus

**Watchlist** — Monitor unlimited artists with per-artist configuration
- Release type filters: Albums, EPs, Singles
- Content filters: Live, Remixes, Acoustic, Compilations
- Auto-discover similar artists, periodic scanning

**Wishlist** — Failed downloads automatically queued for retry with auto-processing

**Mirrored Playlists** — Mirror from Spotify, Tidal, YouTube, Deezer and keep synced
- Auto-refresh detects source changes via URL/ID tracking in playlist metadata
- Discovery pipeline matches source tracks to user's primary metadata source (Spotify/iTunes/Deezer/Discogs)
- Auto Wing It fallback — tracks that fail all metadata APIs get stub metadata from the raw source title and flow through the normal download pipeline anyway
- Followed Spotify playlists that hit 403 errors fall back to public embed scraper
- Unmatch button on found tracks with DB persistence for mirrored playlists

**Local Profiles** — Multiple configuration profiles with isolated settings, watchlists, and playlists

### Library Management

**Dashboard** — Service status, system stats, activity feed, enrichment worker controls
- Unified glass UI design across all tool cards, service cards, and stat cards

**Library Page** — Artist grid with staggered card animations, per-artist enrichment coverage rings
- Artist Radio button — play random track with auto-queue radio mode
- Play buttons on Last.fm top tracks sidebar

**Enhanced Library Manager** — Toggle between Standard and Enhanced views
- Inline metadata editing, per-service manual matching
- Write Tags to File (MP3/FLAC/OGG/M4A), tag preview with diff
- Server sync after tag writes (Plex, Jellyfin, Navidrome)
- Bulk operations, sortable columns, multi-disc support

**Library Maintenance** — 10+ automated repair jobs
- Track Number, Dead Files, Duplicates, Metadata Gaps, Album Completeness, Missing Cover Art, AcoustID Scanner, Orphan Files, Fake Lossless, Library Reorganize, Lossy Converter, MBID Mismatch, Album Tag Consistency, Live/Commentary Cleaner
- Enrichment workers auto-pause during database scans
- One-click Fix All with findings dashboard

**Database Storage Visualization** — Donut chart showing per-table storage breakdown

**Live Log Viewer** — Real-time terminal-style log viewer on Settings → Logs. Color-coded levels (DEBUG/INFO/WARNING/ERROR), live filter + search, switch between log files (app, post-processing, AcoustID, source reuse). Auto-scroll, copy, clear. Updates via WebSocket every 0.5s.

**Import System** — Tag-first matching, auto-grouped album cards, staging folder workflow
- Auto-Import worker: recursive scan, single file support, AcoustID fingerprinting fallback
- Confidence-gated: 90%+ auto-imports, 70-90% queued for review

**SoulSync Standalone Mode** — Use SoulSync without Plex, Jellyfin, or Navidrome
- Downloads and imports write directly to the library database
- Filesystem scanner for incremental and deep scan of Transfer folder
- Pre-populated enrichment IDs from download context (Spotify, Deezer, MusicBrainz)
- Select in Settings → Connections → Standalone

**Template Organization** — `$albumartist/$album/$track - $title` and 10+ variables

### Built-in Media Player

- Stream tracks from your library with queue system
- Now Playing modal with album art ambient glow and Web Audio visualizer
- Smart Radio mode — auto-queue similar tracks by genre, mood, and style
- Repeat modes, shuffle, keyboard shortcuts, Media Session API

## Installation

### Docker (Recommended)

```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nezreka/SoulSync/main/docker-compose.yml
docker-compose up -d
# Access at http://localhost:8008
```

### Release Channels

SoulSync publishes two Docker image tracks so you can choose your level of stability.

**Stable — `:latest`** (recommended for most users). Hand-promoted from the `dev` branch to `main` when a batch of changes is ready for release. Published to Docker Hub. Your `docker-compose.yml` pulls this by default — no changes needed.

```bash
docker pull boulderbadgedad/soulsync:latest
```

**Nightly — `:dev`**. Rebuilt every night from the `dev` branch (and on every push to dev). Published to GitHub Container Registry. Gets new features and bug fixes before they reach `:latest`, at the cost of occasional instability as changes settle. Good for early adopters, contributors validating their own merges, and anyone helping shake out bugs on Discord before a stable release.

To switch, edit `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
image: ghcr.io/nezreka/soulsync:dev
```

Then run `docker-compose pull && docker-compose up -d`.

Pinned dev builds are also published as `ghcr.io/nezreka/soulsync:dev-YYYYMMDD-<sha>` if you want to stick with an exact known-good snapshot.

**Version-tagged releases** (e.g. `:2.3`, `:2.4`) are permanent tags published on both registries when a stable release is promoted:

```bash
docker pull boulderbadgedad/soulsync:2.4
# or
docker pull ghcr.io/nezreka/soulsync:2.4
```

| You are... | Use |
|---|---|
| A typical user who wants things to work | `:latest` |
| Pinning to a specific version for stability | `:2.3`, `:2.4`, etc. |
| An early adopter who wants new features early and is OK reporting bugs | `:dev` |
| A contributor testing post-merge behavior | `:dev` or a pinned dev build |

### Unraid

SoulSync is available as an Unraid template. Install from Community Applications or manually add the template from:
```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nezreka/SoulSync/main/templates/soulsync.xml
```

PUID/PGID are exposed in the template — set them to match your Unraid permissions (default: 99/100 for nobody/users).

The template points at `boulderbadgedad/soulsync:latest` (stable) by default. To use the nightly `:dev` channel on Unraid, edit the container's **Repository** field to `ghcr.io/nezreka/soulsync:dev` after installing from the template.

### Python (No Docker)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Nezreka/SoulSync
cd SoulSync
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
gunicorn -c gunicorn.conf.py wsgi:application
# Open http://localhost:8008
```

### Local Development

Use two terminals so the backend and Vite stay independent:

1. Backend
   ```bash
   python -m pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
   gunicorn -c gunicorn.dev.conf.py wsgi:application
   ```
   The dev Gunicorn config watches backend files and restarts the Python server when they change.
2. Frontend
   ```bash
   cd webui
   npm ci
   npm run dev -- --host 127.0.0.1 --port 5173
   ```
   Vite hot reloads the React side when you change webui files.

Run tests separately when needed:

```bash
python -m pytest
```

If you want a convenience launcher, `./dev.sh` starts both halves together.
It is most useful on Linux, macOS, and WSL.

## Setup Guide

### Prerequisites

- **slskd** running and accessible ([Download](https://github.com/slskd/slskd/releases)) — required for Soulseek downloads
- **Spotify API** credentials ([Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard)) — optional but recommended for discovery
- **Media Server** (optional): Plex, Jellyfin, or Navidrome
- **Deezer ARL token** (optional): For Deezer downloads — get from browser cookies after logging into deezer.com
- **Tidal account** (optional): For Tidal downloads — authenticate via device flow in Settings
- **Qobuz account** (optional): For Qobuz downloads — email/password login in Settings

### Step 1: Set Up slskd

SoulSync talks to slskd through its API. See the [slskd setup guide](https://github.com/slskd/slskd) for API key configuration.

1. Add an API key in slskd's `settings.yml` under `web > authentication > api_keys`
2. Restart slskd
3. Paste the key into SoulSync's Settings → Downloads → Soulseek section

**Configure file sharing in slskd to avoid Soulseek bans.** Set up shared folders at `http://localhost:5030/shares`.

### Step 2: Set Up Spotify API (Optional)

Spotify gives you the best discovery features. Without it, SoulSync falls back to iTunes/Deezer for metadata.

1. Create an app at [developer.spotify.com/dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard)
2. Add Redirect URI: `http://127.0.0.1:8888/callback`
3. Copy Client ID and Client Secret into SoulSync Settings

More detail in [Support/DOCKER-OAUTH-FIX.md](Support/DOCKER-OAUTH-FIX.md).

### Step 3: Configure SoulSync

Open SoulSync at `http://localhost:8008` and go to Settings.

**Download Source**: Choose your preferred source (Soulseek, Deezer, Tidal, Qobuz, HiFi, YouTube, or Hybrid)

**Paths**:
- **Input Folder**: Container path to slskd's download folder (e.g., `/app/downloads`)
- **Output Folder**: Where organized music goes (e.g., `/app/Transfer`)
- **Import Folder**: Optional folder for importing existing music (e.g., `/app/Staging`)

**Media Server** (optional): Use your machine's actual IP (not `localhost` — that means inside the container)

### Step 4: Docker Path Mapping

| What | Container Path | Host Path |
|------|---------------|-----------|
| Config | `/app/config` | Your config folder |
| Logs | `/app/logs` | Your logs folder |
| Database | `/app/data` | Named volume (recommended) |
| Input | `/app/downloads` | Same folder slskd downloads to |
| Output | `/app/Transfer` | Where organized music goes |
| Import | `/app/Staging` | Optional folder for importing music |

**Important:** Use a named volume for the database (`soulsync_database:/app/data`). Direct host path mounts to `/app/data` can overwrite Python module files.

## Contributing

### Branch workflow

SoulSync uses a `dev` → `main` flow:

- **`main`** — release branch. `:latest` images auto-build from this. Only receives merges from `dev`.
- **`dev`** — integration branch. Nightly `:dev` images build from here. PRs land here first for validation before being promoted to `main`.
- **Feature branches** — branched from `dev`. PRs target `dev`.

### Opening a PR

1. Fork and clone the repo
2. Branch off `dev`: `git checkout -b fix/your-change dev`
3. Make your changes and commit
4. Push and open a PR against **`dev`** (not `main`)
5. CI (`build-and-test.yml`) runs ruff lint + compile + `python -m pytest` on your branch — wait for green
6. A maintainer reviews and merges

### Running locally

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
python -m ruff check .       # must be 0 errors
python -m pytest             # all tests must pass
```

For web UI development, keep the backend and Vite dev server in separate terminals:

```bash
gunicorn -c gunicorn.dev.conf.py wsgi:application
cd webui
npm install
npm run dev -- --host 127.0.0.1 --port 5173
```

If you want a convenience wrapper, `./dev.sh` starts both halves together.

Ruff config lives in `pyproject.toml`. The ruleset is intentionally lenient — it catches real bugs (undefined names, import shadowing, closure-in-loop) without style nits.

### Reporting bugs / requesting features

Open an issue on GitHub. For user-side support, the Discord community is the fastest place to ask.
